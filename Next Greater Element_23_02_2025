Next Greater Element
Given an array arr[ ] of integers, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1. For example, next greater of the last element is always -1.
Examples
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesn't exist, it is -1.

Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 , for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 50]
Output: [20, 30, 50, -1]
Explanation: For a sorted array, the next element is next greater element also exxept for the last element.

Input: arr[] = [50, 40, 30, 10]
Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
Explanation: There is no greater element for any of the elements in the array, so all are -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)Auxiliary Space: O(n)


Optimized Approach:
Initialize an empty result list and a stack.
Traverse the array from right to left.
Remove elements from the stack that are smaller than or equal to the current element.
Store the top element of the stack as the next greater element, or -1 if the stack is empty.
Insert the result at the beginning of the list.
Push the current element onto the stack.
Return the result list.


class Solution {
    // Function to find the next greater element for each element of the array.
    public ArrayList<Integer> nextLargerElement(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        ArrayList<Integer> nge=new ArrayList<>();
        Stack<Integer> st=new Stack<>();
        
        for(int i=arr.length-1;i>=0;i--){
                // Pop elements from stack smaller than the current element
                while(!st.isEmpty() && st.peek()<=arr[i]){
                    st.pop();
                }
                int ans=st.isEmpty()?-1:st.peek();
                nge.add(0,ans);
                
                // Push current element to stack
                st.push(arr[i]);
        }
        
        return nge;
    }
}
